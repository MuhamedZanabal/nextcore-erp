# 🚀 NextCore ERP - GitHub Upload Instructions

## ✅ Repository is Ready for Upload!

Your NextCore ERP project is fully prepared and ready to be uploaded to GitHub. The git repository is initialized with all commits ready.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Upload Process

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub (Manual)

Since the token doesn't have repository creation permissions, please follow these steps:

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account (`MuhamedZanabal`)

2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner and select "New repository"

3. **Fill in repository details:**
   - **Repository name**: `nextcore-erp`
   - **Description**: `🚀 NextCore ERP - Modern, Cloud-Native Enterprise Resource Planning Platform with Microservices Architecture. Features CRM, Sales, Invoicing, Inventory, Accounting, and HRM modules with React frontend and Kubernetes deployment.`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **Important**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code (Automated)

Once you've created the repository, run this command to upload everything:

```bash
cd /workspace/NextCoreERP
git remote add origin https://github.com/MuhamedZanabal/nextcore-erp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, your repository should contain:

```
