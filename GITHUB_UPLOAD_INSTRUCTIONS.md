# GitHub Upload Instructions for NextCore ERP

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner → "New repository"
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `nextcore-erp`
   - **Description**: `NextCore ERP - Production-grade, cloud-native ERP platform built with microservices architecture. Modern alternative to Odoo with React frontend, NestJS backend, and comprehensive business modules.`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /workspace/NextCoreERP

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nextcore-erp.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create nextcore-erp --public --description "NextCore ERP - Production-grade, cloud-native ERP platform" --push
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, you should see all files in your GitHub repository including:

- ✅ Complete project structure with all services
- ✅ Documentation (README.md, guides, checklists)
- ✅ Docker and Kubernetes configurations
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configuration
- ✅ Monitoring and infrastructure setup
- ✅ Frontend application with React
- ✅ All backend services (Auth, CRM, Sales, etc.)

## Repository Features to Enable

After upload, consider enabling these GitHub features:

1. **Issues**: For bug tracking and feature requests
2. **Projects**: For project management and roadmap
3. **Wiki**: For additional documentation
4. **Discussions**: For community engagement
5. **Security**: Enable security advisories and dependency scanning

## Next Steps After Upload

1. **Add Repository Topics**: Add relevant tags like `erp`, `microservices`, `nestjs`, `react`, `typescript`, `kubernetes`
2. **Create Releases**: Tag important milestones
3. **Set up Branch Protection**: Protect main branch with required reviews
4. **Configure GitHub Actions**: The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run
5. **Add Contributors**: Invite team members if working collaboratively
